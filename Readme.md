# Framework is exactly what is says on the tin.

### For Modrinth Users
This pack is what I believe every performance pack should have. No more. No less. This means that anyone can take it and have a high performance pack with no extra flair. Perfectly vanilla Minecraft, but performant.

### For Modpack Developers
A pack developer could use this pack as a framework for a different pack, without having to look for all the performance mods themselves. This saves time and allows the developer to get straight to the extra bits.
